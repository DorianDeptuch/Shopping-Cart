        <h3>CLIMBING</h3>
        <p>
          Climbing is our heritage. We started with a backyard anvil and hammer
          in search of new ways to ascend the big walls of Yosemite Valley.
          Today, that same spirit of ingenuity envelopes everything we do. From
          the indelible Camalot, to the world’s first wire-gate climbing
          carabiner, we’ve protected rock, wild places and wild climbers for
          generations. This is our legacy.
